            <h2>What we get from Nutrient Food</h2>
            <p>
                You should choose a diet made of nutrient-rich foods. Nutrient-rich (or nutrient-dense) foods are low in sugar, sodium, starches, and bad fats. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories. Your body needs vitamins and minerals, known as micronutrients. They nourish your body and help keep you healthy. They can reduce your risk for chronic diseases. Getting them through food ensures your body can absorb them properly.
                Try to eat a variety of foods to get different vitamins and minerals. Foods that naturally are nutrient-rich include fruits and vegetables. Lean meats, fish, whole grains, dairy, legumes, nuts, and seeds also are high in nutrients. <br>
                <b>Fiber:</b> Legumes (dried beans and peas), whole-grain foods and brans, seeds, apples, strawberries, carrots, raspberries, and colorful fruit and vegetables. <br>
                <b>Vitamin E:</b> Avocados, nuts, seeds, whole-grain foods, and spinach and other dark leafy greens. <br>
                <b>Vitamin A: </b>Eggs, milk, carrots, sweet potatoes, and cantaloupe. <br>
               <b> Calcium: </b>Nonfat and low-fat dairy, dairy substitutes, broccoli, dark, leafy greens, and sardines. <br>
                <b>Potassium: </b> Bananas, cantaloupe, raisins, nuts, fish, and spinach and other dark greens. <br>

                <p>Preheat oven to 400°F (200˚C).
                    In a bowl, mix together the salmon, chili sauce, and the scallions.
                    Place the fillets on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Spoon any leftover sauce on top of the salmon.
                    Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the salmon is cooked but still tender.
                    Enjoy!

                <h2> SLOW COOKER SALSA CHICKEN</h2>
                <p>To make this salsa chicken, just pop some raw chicken in a slow cooker. (I didn’t want to mess with bones, so went with chicken breasts for easy shredding.)  Then cover it with lots of your favorite salsa. (I used the restaurant-style salsa that I posted yesterday.)  Season it with some extra salt and pepper, give it a stir, and then let your slow cooker do its thing.
